# About
MyGeneration is an extremely flexible template based code generator written in Microsoft .NET. MyGeneration is great at generating code for ORM architectures. The meta-data from your database is made available to the templates through the MyMeta API.

Do not use this software for new projects. Use another tool like T4 templates instead.

# History
This repository is a clone of the original repository on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mygeneration/). While there is a previous fork on GitHub, if I do proceed with making updates I'd rather start fresh with the version my company currently uses.
